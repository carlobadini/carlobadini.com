    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m Carlo. Welcome to my own little corner of the internet.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Iâ€™m an entrepreneur at heart. In my early 20s I started my first business
      and bootstrapped it profitably to 40+ employees while studying full-time
      at the University of Bern in Switzerland. I invested in some quite
      successful startups. I give regular talks and speeches at various forums
      and universities. I currently serve on one board. And Iâ€™m actively
      involved in a handful of nonprofits. I received numerous awards and
      recognitions for my work. I work out 5-6 times a week, try to eat healthy
      and I consider myself an avid reader. I work hard. And I work a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this may sound impressive by traditional measures. Know, though,
      that this is - while being true - also a very incomplete picture of me.
      This whole site is composed with the intent of marketing myself. All my
      countless mistakes, failures and bad decisions are conveniently sweeped
      under the rug. But rest assured that there are many, many mistakes I
      commited, bad turns I took and poor decisions I made. Someday I will
      publish an exhaustive list of all my failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all that being said, take everything here (or anywhere else for that
      matter) with a grain (or two, or three) of salt.
    </p>
    <p>Cheers!</p>
